ProfileScalaExample
============

A simple example of profiling for scala programs.

Works for Spark applications, at least on things executed on the driver.

# Dependencies

This is an example of [erikvanoosten/metrics-scala](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala)
usage.
This library provides tools to profile applications, capturing JVM- and application-level metrics.

The metrics-scala library is based on the java [dropwizard/metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics).
You can browse its [documentation](http://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/manual/)
to see all types of metrics available.

# How it works

Comments in the code should be enough to understand.
This is a minimalistic example.
Of course, real use-cases could be more complicated.
